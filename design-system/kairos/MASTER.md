# Kairos — Notebook design system

**Source of truth for visual craft** across the desktop app (`app/src`), the Chrome extension (`app/extension-chrome`), and the marketing site (`landing/`). Adopted 2026-10-07 from the three-direction exploration in [`explorations/2026-10-07/`](../explorations/2026-10-07/) (the owner picked `c-notebook.html`). It replaces the Living Instrument / Spatial Instrument systems; where an older doc disagrees with this one, this one wins.

## 01 Direction

Kairos should feel like **a friend's really good notes**: a clean page, one highlighter, a few handwritten arrows pointing at what matters. Warm and friendly like Duolingo, calm and quiet like Things. Never sharp, technical, dark-dashboard, or "AI product".

Three ideas carry the whole system:

1. **The page.** Content sits on near-white paper with hairline rules. Hierarchy comes from type weight and size, not from boxes, shadows, or glass.
2. **The highlighter.** Exactly one brand color, `--hl` yellow. It marks the single most important thing on a screen: a phrase in a headline, today's focus block, the primary button's shadow. If two things are highlighted, neither is.
3. **The margin.** Handwritten blue notes (Caveat, `--pen`) explain the product the way a classmate would ("this one moved!", "taller = worth more"). They live in the margins, point with drawn arrows, and draw themselves in once.

Personality beyond that comes from **what students would rather be doing**: hand-drawn outdoor scenes and activities (climbing, skiing, surfing, a hike, a concert). There is **no mascot**. The only animated "presence" is the voice presence (§08), and it is abstract.

## 02 Principles

- **Show, don't tell.** Real course names, real dates, real grades on every surface, including marketing. No lorem ipsum, no feature lists where a screenshot would do.
- **One subject per screen.** Decide what the student should do next; make it the largest thing. Everything else is a quiet list.
- **Lists, not card grids.** Rows separated by 1px hairlines. A sheet (white, hairline border) only when content is a distinct object: a dialog, the focus block, a preview.
- **Course colors are data.** Each course has one color, used for its tag, its ticks on the semester line, and nothing decorative.
- **Plain words.** Sentence case everywhere. No uppercase eyebrow labels, no numbered `01 / 02` indexes, no middle-dot metadata chains. Write "Thu, Oct 9 at 11:59 PM", not "Oct 9 · 11:59 PM MDT (America/Denver)".
- **Honest states.** Empty, loading, and error states are designed and written as plainly as the happy path ("Couldn't reach your study notes. Try again.").

## 03 Color

```css
/* Notebook (light, default)  [data-theme="paper"] */
--bg:        #fbfbfa;   /* the desk */
--sheet:     #ffffff;   /* the page */
--sheet-2:   #f7f7f5;   /* sidebar, quiet wells */
--fg:        #1d1d1f;   /* ink */
--muted:     #66666b;   /* pencil */
--hairline:  #e9e9e7;
--hl:        #ffe14d;   /* highlighter: the one brand color */
--hl-soft:   #fff4b3;   /* focus block, selected row */
--hl-ink:    #4a3f00;   /* text on --hl-soft */
--pen:       #2f5bea;   /* margin handwriting + focus ring only */
--danger:    #c8432b;
--success:   #2f8f5b;

/* Night notebook  [data-theme="night"]: same roles on a dark page */
--bg: #161618; --sheet: #1e1e21; --sheet-2: #1a1a1d; --fg: #f1f1ed; --muted: #a2a29e;
--hairline: #2e2e32; --hl: #ffe14d; --hl-soft: #3a3412; --hl-ink: #ffe98a; --pen: #8fb0ff;

/* High contrast  [data-theme="contrast"]: #000/#fff, 2px rules, --hl stays, no shadows */
```

Rules:

- `--hl` never carries text directly on white UI except as a marker swipe *behind* ink. Text on `--hl-soft` uses `--hl-ink`.
- `--pen` is for handwriting and the focus ring. It is not a link or button color.
- Links are ink with a 1px underline; hover thickens the underline.
- Course palette (assigned by sync, `inbox/courses/colors.json`): `#4a8fe7 #3fb07c #ef6a4c #9a7ae0 #e5a422 #2fb3b8 #d4579a #7c8a99`. Tags render as `color-mix(in srgb, <course> 14%, white)` with text `color-mix(in srgb, <course> 70%, black)`.
- No gradients on UI, no glow, no glass, no pure `#000`/`#fff` text pairs outside high contrast.

## 04 Type

| Role | Face | Size / leading / weight |
|---|---|---|
| Display (scene title, hero) | Gabarito | 40–76px / 1.02 / 800, tracking −0.035em |
| Heading | Gabarito | 22–30px / 1.1 / 800, tracking −0.02em |
| UI | Gabarito | 15–16px / 1.35 / 500–600 |
| Prose (study) | Gabarito | 17–19px / 1.6 / 500, 45–70ch |
| Meta | Gabarito | 13–14px / 1.3 / 500, `--muted` |
| Numbers | Gabarito with `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` | — |
| Margin note | Caveat | 20–26px / 1.05 / 700, `--pen`, rotated −4° to 4° |

IBM Plex Mono survives only for genuinely technical text (diagnostics, file paths). Never as decoration.

Emphasis inside a headline is a **marker swipe** (`.mark`), never a color change, italic, or a second typeface.

## 05 Geometry and space

- Radii: page/sheet `14px`, control `10px`, row hover `7px`, tag `6px`, pill only for segmented controls. Nothing rounder.
- Rules: 1px `--hairline`; 1.5px for checkbox borders; 2px only in high contrast.
- Shadow: one soft page shadow for sheets that float (`0 1px 0 var(--hairline), 0 18px 40px rgba(29,29,31,.06)`). Nothing else gets a shadow except the primary button's hard highlighter offset.
- Spacing scale: 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 72, 96. Lists use 11–14px row padding.
- Minimum hit target 44×44 (rows count).

## 06 Components

**Primary button.** Ink background, white text, 10px radius, `box-shadow: 3px 3px 0 var(--hl)`. Hover lifts 1px up-left and grows the shadow to 4px. Active presses in 3px and the shadow goes to 0. One per view.

**Secondary button.** Sheet background, 1px hairline border, ink text. Active: `translateY(1px)`.

**Quiet button / link.** Ink text, underline on hover. Used for Prev/Next, "Open in Canvas", etc.

**Row.** Checkbox or course swatch, title (600), optional meta line (`--muted`, 14px), right-aligned tag or relative day. Hairline between rows. Hover: `--sheet-2` background with 7px radius.

**Course tag.** 13px/600, 5px 8px padding, 6px radius, course tint (§03).

**Focus block.** `--hl-soft` sheet, 12px radius, heading + one sentence + primary button. At most one per screen.

**Segmented control.** Pill track `--sheet-2`, selected segment `--sheet` with hairline and ink text.

**Sidebar.** `--sheet-2` with a right hairline. Items are 15px/600 `--muted` with a simple glyph; the current item is ink on `#ececea` (night: `#26262a`). Courses listed below with their swatch.

**Forms.** Label above input (14px/600). Inputs: sheet, 1px hairline, 10px radius, 44px tall, focus ring `--pen`. Helper and error text below the field.

**Sheet / dialog.** Sheet with page shadow, 14px radius, no backdrop blur; backdrop is `rgba(22,22,24,.28)`.

**Semester line.** One lane per course: label, hairline baseline, ticks whose height = grade weight in the course color, a dashed ink "today" line. Hover bubble is a small sheet.

**Margin note.** `.note` in Caveat with an SVG arrow (stroke `--pen`, 2.4px, round caps). Max two per screen, never over prose, `aria-hidden` (the information must exist in text elsewhere).

## 07 Illustration

- Subject matter: outdoor activities and campus life students do once the week is handled. Small people, big landscape. Never a "student at laptop".
- Style: single-weight hand-drawn ink line (2–2.5px, round caps), with at most one fill of `--hl` or one course color. Base assets come from **Open Peeps / Open Doodles / Humaaans (CC0, Pablo Stanley)** recolored to ink; anything custom must match that line quality.
- Placement: landing sections, onboarding scenes, empty states ("Nothing due until Monday. Go outside."). Never on Study, never behind text.
- Photography/video (landing only): real footage from Pexels/Mixkit (free license) or real student clips. No AI-generated people, ever.

## 08 Voice presence

Voice must have a presence; it must not be a character.

- **Form:** the "ink ring": three or four soft overlapping loops (ink, `--pen`, `--hl`) inside a 72–120px circle, like ink diffusing in water. Abstract, no face.
- **States** (from `useVoicePresence()`): `idle` hidden · `listening` loops open and track mic level · `thinking` loops slowly orbit · `speaking` loops ripple outward with output level · `done` one settle-in, then the sheet closes.
- **Where:** the voice sheet (bottom-center sheet with live caption + Stop) and onboarding's voice step. It may appear as a 24px mark in the extension header while voice is live. Never resident on Home or Study.
- **Access:** decorative (`aria-hidden`); the sheet carries a text status ("Listening…", "Thinking…"), the live caption, and a Stop button. Reduced motion shows a still ring per state.
- No losable state, no moods, no guilt.

Implementation: `app/src/voice/InkRing.tsx` (canvas, dependency-free). The old Blot engine (`app/src/blot/core`) is retired from the UI.

## 09 Motion

Motion only for real state changes:

| Verb | Use | Spec |
|---|---|---|
| Settle | view load | 200ms ease-out, opacity + 4px rise |
| Press | button/row press | 90–120ms; primary button shadow collapses |
| Draw | margin notes, marker swipe, first reveal only | 500–700ms stroke-dashoffset / background-size |
| Live | voice presence | continuous only while voice is active |

`--ease: cubic-bezier(.22,1,.36,1)`. Never `transition: all`. No bounce, confetti, shimmer, or idle loops. `prefers-reduced-motion` and `data-motion="reduced"` remove travel and drawing; state still changes instantly.

## 10 Screen recipes

- **Onboarding:** one question per screen, centered column 440px, big Gabarito question, one primary button. School is *found*, not picked from a hard-coded list (§12). A small outdoor doodle on the welcome and done screens.
- **Home:** date as display heading, "Good morning, <name>.", the focus block for the single most important item, then the next few rows, then the semester line. No dashboard tiles.
- **Plan / Calendar:** the same row grammar; calendar grid cells are hairline boxes with course-colored tags.
- **Study:** page sheet, 17–19px prose, one question at a time, progress as plain text ("3 of 6"). No illustration, no margin notes over prose.
- **Exam prep:** day-by-day rows, today's row highlighted with `--hl-soft`.
- **Settings:** left list of groups (plain words, no numbers), right panel with forms.
- **Extension side panel:** the same row and focus-block grammar at 360px.

## 11 Landing page

Static, self-contained, no build step (deployed from `landing/` on Vercel). Same tokens. Order: hero (headline with one marker swipe + product page with margin notes) → the app in use → "what the grade really is" (grade math example) → how sign-in works → privacy in two plain columns → waitlist. Copy rules: no em-dashes, no buzzwords, ≤20-word subtext, one CTA label for one intent ("Get early access"). Social proof only from real people; no fabricated testimonials, avatars, or counts (FTC 2024 rule).

## 12 School personalization (visual rules)

The student's school is discovered (Instructure account search → their Canvas host → Canvas data). The UI may show the school's name and use the school's Canvas brand color **only** as a small swatch next to the school name in onboarding/settings. It never replaces `--hl` or recolors the app. Architecture: [`docs/architecture/school-personalization.md`](../../docs/architecture/school-personalization.md).

## 13 Anti-patterns (instant fail)

Uppercase eyebrow labels · numbered section indexes · em-dashes in UI copy · middle-dot metadata chains · mono type as costume · glass/blur · gradients, glows, neon · dark sidebar on a light page · 3-up equal card grids · nested cards · colored left-border cards · emoji as icons · a mascot or face · fake screenshots built from divs on marketing (use the real UI components) · fabricated testimonials · progress bars with tracks as decoration · "Get started / Learn more" CTAs · hard-coded school names in product UI.

## 14 Acceptance test

A screen ships when: the next action is obvious in two seconds; it works with motion off; contrast passes WCAG AA in all three themes; there is at most one highlighted thing; every string reads like a person wrote it; and a screenshot looks like a page from Kairos, not a template.
